				<tbody>
				  <tr>
					<td>Effective Communication</td>
					<td>Public speaking allows individuals to express their thoughts, ideas, 
						and messages clearly and persuasively to an audience. It enables effective communication and 
						facilitates the transmission of information, knowledge, and opinions. Whether in personal, 
						academic, or professional contexts, being able to articulate oneself in a compelling manner is 
						crucial for conveying messages and influencing others.</td>
				  </tr>
				  <tr>
					<td>Building Confidence</td>
					<td>Engaging in public speaking helps build confidence and self-assurance. 
						By facing the challenge of speaking in front of others, individuals can overcome the fear of 
						public speaking and develop a sense of empowerment. With practice and experience, they gain the 
						confidence to express themselves assertively and present their ideas convincingly.</td>
				  </tr>
				  <tr>
					<td>Leadership Development</td>
					<td>Public speaking is an integral part of leadership. Leaders often need 
						to inspire and motivate others, deliver speeches, and communicate their vision effectively. By 
						honing their public speaking skills, individuals can enhance their leadership abilities, establish
						 credibility, and gain the trust and respect of their audience.</td>
				  </tr>
				  <tr>
					<td>Career Advancement</td>
					<td>Public speaking skills are highly valued in various professional fields. 
						Being an effective public speaker can open doors to career opportunities, promotions, and 
						professional growth. Whether presenting ideas to colleagues, pitching proposals to clients, or
